This Android application demonstrates an image rotation feature where images automatically change every 10 seconds. It also includes a Pause/Resume button to control the image rotation.

Features:
Automatic image rotation every 10 seconds.
Pause and Resume functionality for the image rotation.
Smooth transition with a fade-in effect when changing images.
Changes Made:
In this project, I implemented the image rotation logic and added a Pause/Resume button to control the rotation. I also added a fade-in animation for smooth transitions between images. The main code updates were made in the MainActivity.kt file to handle the image switching functionality and button interaction.
